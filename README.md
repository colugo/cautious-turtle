#Alpha/Beta Tech Capability Maturity model


## Capability 1: Version Control
Version control systems allow teams to colloborate on projects, manage access and modifications to team artefacts, which are stored within a centrally available repository.

### Maturity level 1
 - The team all have access to, and regularly use, the repository
 - Only one branch is used for development
 - Only completed features are commited to the repository
 - Only the repository features of the version control system are used

### Maturity level 2
 - Multiple branches are used to introudce new functionality, but take several days to merge back into main branch
 -  Configuration files and dependancies are stored within the version control system, but manual modifications to the development environment are required
 - Commits to the repository are made daily, typically at the end of the day.
 - Other features of the version control system, such as identifying differences and metrics are starting to be used


### Maturity level 3
 - The version control system is used to authoritatively hold the projects code, dependancies and configuration. 
 - The team routinely use branches for exploritory feature development
 - The team contibutes to the repository multiple times thoughout the day
 - The team exploit all features of the version control system: triggering builds, code reviews, comments, feature requests, notifications, etc
 - The repository always contains working code, and isn't ever in a broken state
 - Important points in the project's history are tagged, and archived for future reference

## Capability 2: Testing
Verifying that the users needs are met, and that the system operates as expected

### Maturity level 1
  -  The product is manually verified each release against a set-list of test cases
  -  

### Maturity level 2
  - tdd
  - 

### Maturity level 3
  - user accepance testing
  -
