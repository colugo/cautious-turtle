## Capability: Deployment 
Deployment is the process of testing, packaging, deploying, configuring and releasing software.

Delivering new features to users should quick, simple and bullet-proof.

```
"Releasing software is too often an art;
it should be an engineering discipline."

"There should be be two tasks for a human being to perform to deploy
software into a development, test, or production environment:
to pick the version and environment and to push the 'deploy' button"

-- David Farley


Done means "released". This implies ownership of a project right up
until it’s in the hands of the user, and working properly.
There’s none of this "I’ve checked in my code so it’s done as far as I’m concerned"

-- James Betteley
