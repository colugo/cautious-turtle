## Capability: Back end development

Development converts ideas, assumptions, and user stories into a running, functioning, system.

then programming must be the process of putting them in.”

### Level 1
 - Class, method, instance and variable names are meaningless:
 
 ```
 int i;
 String upn;
 ```

 - Code is needlessly complex, difficult to read and poorly formatted
 - The code doesn't reflect the user's vocabulary:
```
patient.setShotType(ShotTypes.TYPE_FLU);
patient.setDose(dose);
patient.setNurse(nurse);
```

 - Language specific conventions aren't being followed ( java => getters/setters, c# => properties, ruby => attr_accessor, etc.. )
 - Common methods and behaviour are duplicated throughout the code base
 - Objects exhibit inappropriate intimacy and indecent exposure:
```
return window().getForm().getElements().getElementById('name').getLength();
```
 - The team don't feel proud of the code; it's difficult to work with and very brittle, resulting in stagnation, degradation and abandonment.
 - The team's velocity is very low and haphazard and unpredictable.
 - Programming is a stressful experience.

### Level 2
 - Class, method, instance and variable names convey their intent and purpose:
 ```
 int currentChild;
 String userPreferredName;
  ``` 
 - Code is clean and appropriately documented which makes it easier for others to read and maintain
 - Technical debt is continually measured, and given high priority during sprint planning
 - Classes have a single responsibility


### Level 3
 - Methods are small, single purpose, and don't create side effects
 - Code is self-documenting, and the intent and structure are self-evident based on the user's vocabulary:
```
Vaccine vaccine = vaccines.standardAdultFluDose();
nurse.administerFluVaccine(patient, vaccine);
```
 - Code is continually refactored to be simpler, cleaner, easier to understand and work with
 - The team are proud of their code; it's a joy to work on and improve. Introducing new features is quick, simple.
 - The team's velocity is high and consistent; features are delivered to users on time
 - Programming is fun again.
