## Capability: Back end development

Development converts ideas, assumptions, and user stories into a running, functioning, system.

then programming must be the process of putting them in.”

### Level 1
 - Big ball of mud
 - Code is needlessly complex, difficult to read and poorly formatted
 - Language specific conventions aren't being followed (java => getters/setters, c# => properties, ruby => attr_accessor etc..)
 - Common methods and behaviour are duplicated throughout the code base

### Level 2
 - Code is clean and appropriately documented which makes it easier for others to read and maintain
 - Classes have a single responsibility


### Level 3
 - Single responsibility 
 - Methods are small, single purpose, and don't create side effects
