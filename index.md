title: Alpha/Beta Tech Capability  Model
---



This model outlines the capabilities required for teams to successfully deliver transformation projects.

## Capabilities

Each capability is a high-level activity that contributes to the overall success of project delivery, which is broken down into three maturity levels that group the typical activities and behaviours that teams use to implement the capability.

**Level 1 - Fixer-upper** : Teams are continuing to do things the way they have always been done. Processes and tools have been cobbled together over time, but aren't really helping deliver value to the users.

The team know that there are areas that can be improved, and have some passing knowledge of best-practices, but haven't had the opportunities to try them.


**Level 2 - Improving** : Teams are taking measured steps towards improvements in their internal processes and practices. Whilst new and challenging, these steps increase the agility of the team, which leads to better, faster delivery.

The team can sense that things are improving, and are motivated to learn more about delivery improvements.


**Level 3 - Best practice** : Teams operating at this level are on the cutting-edge of delivery practices, which are tried-and-tested to deliver better quality, robust, faster, and more meaningful products to the users.

Team members are excited and motivated to be working on cool stuff that really helps them deliver working code quickly.


## Assessing people against the capabilities
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TTYaTRfbTqeLqGc4BiIrodcxnI205DJx4CnziXJMJgU/edit#gid=667432916) is a spreadsheet with sample questions, explanations, and keywords that might help you assess people against the capabilities.

**Example questions**

Sample questions that help you prompt the person into answering questions in a way you can measure.

**Example score card**

A scorecard is produced based on the person's answers, which gives you an at-a-glance view on their maturity level with the capability model.
