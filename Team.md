### Level 1
 - The project is segmented into different features/layers, which are exclusively owned by individual members of the team
 - The team has very low levels of coordination; breaking changes introduced to shared components without discussion / collaboration
 - Nobody knows how the entire system works, just how their component operates
 - The quality and 'feel' of the system differs widely based on the team member who developed it, often resulting in fractured user experiences and perceptions 
 - When something breaks, the common response from the team is "that's not my problem", and the break is unresolved until the component owner fixes it
 - It is rare for new starters to join the development team, but when they do, they find it a very challenging environment.


### Level 2
 - The team collectively own the entire system
 - The team members have specialisations in particular components, but are all able and willing to contribute to the development and maintenance of the entire system
 - The team value and actively participate in knowledge sharing, via techniques such as peer programming, which significantly increases the dissemination of 
 knowledge amongst the team, including to new starters
 - Users feel that the system is consistent, and can quickly understand and use new features because it seems familiar
 

### Level 3
 - Every team member can competently deliver every task
 - Autonomous sub-teams form around particular features, or activities but not in isolation, as they remain completely integrated with the team
 - The team actively collaborate and participate in the design and development of user features
