## Capability: Quality
Testing ensures that:
 -  the users needs are met
 - the system operates as expected
 - bugs that are fixed don't come back

"Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs,
but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence."

 -- Edsger Dijkstra


"Sometimes things fall apart so that better things can fall together"

 -- Marilyn Monroe

### Level 1
  - Automation products are used to record / describe the tests, which can be run on demand
  - Users report more bugs then the testing process
  - The team recognise false-positives by name, and dismiss them with "Oh, that's just the usual exception"
  - For no reason, tests that previously work start to fail, or tests that previously fail start to work 


### Level 2
 - The project is built following TDD, and tests are run religiously throughout the development process, including on committing to the version control repository
 - There are several hard-coded integration tests, which rely on precise configurations of databases or responses from services.
 - Techniques such as MVC /  MVVM are used to decouple the business logic behind views from the presentation of views, allowing the logic to be 'headless' tested.
 - Whenever a defect is identified, an automated test is written to verify it's existence, and when the defect is fixed, the automated test ensures it never happens again
 

### Level 3

 - Code analysis tools are used to identify code coverage, which is 100% for the majority the code base
 - Automated integration and acceptance testing tools are used to ensure that the overarching system works as expected
 -  Dependency injection and mocking frameworks are used to isolate the components under-test from the rest of the system, allowing the components to be tested for a variety of circumstances independently of the dependencies, such as a database.
 - The team have a 'zero exceptions in production' mantra.
