## Capability: Prototyping

Why do engineers build models? Why do aerospace engineers build models of aircraft? Why to structural engineers build models of bridges? What purposes to these models serve?

These engineers build models to find out whether their designs will work. Aerospace engineers build models of aircraft to see whether they will fly. Structural engineers build models of bridges to see whether they will stand. Architects build models of buildings to see whether their clients will like the way they look.
*Models are built to find out whether something will work*

"I have not failed 10,000 times. I have not failed once.
I have succeeded in proving that those 10,000 ways will not work."

### Level 1
 - WYSIWYG: Axure

### Level 2
 - Designers and Developers collaborating on prototypes

### Level 3
 - Designers are using the production development tools (such as HTML and CSS) to produce working prototypes
 - The prototypes are version controlled, **tested?**, **other capabilities?**
