## Capability: Operation

Overview


```
One would go around the back of the computer, turn on the motor (which would come up to
speed) and apply a large screwdriver to the side of it, flat on the V-belt, to increase
the tension to bring the disc up to speed. Then the disc would stay at that speed.
But if you weren’t very good at this, or the belt was loose, the disc might never get up
to speed, and it could stabilise at a lower speed with a bit of slip in the belt.
In this case data could be written on the disk in such a way that you couldn’t erase it
under program control. You would then have to demagnetise the whole disk. The engineers
weren’t too happy if you had an inexperienced applicant of the screwdriver, who didn’t
know how to bring the disk up to speed.



"The thin tape frequently folded over and jammed - you could hear the note of the tape
readers change, as it started to happen.
But Ron could get from one side of the computer room to the other very quickly and stop
them before the paper tape actually tore. He did this by running and then skidding on
the polished floors to a halt beside the printer, just in time to switch it off."

 -- Peter Thorne, talking about Australia's first computer: CSIRAC.
